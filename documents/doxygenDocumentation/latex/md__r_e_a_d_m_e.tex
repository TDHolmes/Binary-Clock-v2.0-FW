A simple but well designed clock that displays the time in \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal}{\tt binary coded decimal}

\subsection*{P\+CB}



The current design uses an Atmel \href{http://www.atmel.com/devices/ATTINY4313.aspx}{\tt A\+Ttiny4313} microcontroller in conjunction with a Maxim \href{https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/digital/real-time-clocks/DS3231M.html}{\tt D\+S3231M} \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_clock}{\tt R\+TC} for accurate time keeping. The L\+E\+Ds are driven with a \href{http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/power-management/led-drivers/led-array-drivers/stp16cpc26.html}{\tt S\+T\+P16\+C\+P\+C26} constant current L\+ED driver along with \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSFET#Single-type}{\tt high-\/side M\+O\+S\+F\+E\+Ts} for \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing}{\tt multiplexing}.

\subsection*{L\+ED Driving Scheme}

The L\+E\+Ds are driven by multiplexing the rows and columns. The columns are dirven individually via P\+M\+OS transistors. The rows are daisy chained and driven by the \href{http://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/power-management/led-drivers/led-array-drivers/stp16cpc26.html}{\tt S\+T\+P16\+C\+P\+C26}. The columns are refreshed at an effective rate of 360 Hz to be equivallent to 60 Hz refresh rate.

In order to get more than basic red, green and blue combinations, the L\+E\+Ds have four time slots to create more color combinations. So in reality, the L\+E\+Ds are updated at (60 Hz) $\ast$ (6 columns) $\ast$ (4 bit color) = 1440 Hz.

Below shows the connectivity of the L\+E\+Ds to the driver chips.



Below is a snapshot in time when the minute ones column is active.



\subsection*{G\+UI}

The user interface communicates to the P\+CB via a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver/transmitter}{\tt U\+A\+RT} through a U\+SB to serial converter chip. The user interface can do a few things\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item set the time to the current computer system time
\item set a custom time
\item set one or all L\+E\+Ds to a certain color
\item clear one or all L\+E\+Ds
\end{DoxyItemize}
